<p>The first part is here: <a href="/blog/add-1/">Intro</a>.  In the previous parts I described the big picture, Vagrant and EC2,
node initialization, the one minute configuration HeartBeat, HipChat integration, presence, and EC2 integration.</p>

<h2>Configuring Node Parts and even fuller Presence and visibility</h2>

<p>So far our node was a generic &#8216;ControlNode&#8217;.  A ControlNode is a node that is in your data center
(to be near the other nodes), similar to your actual nodes, and configured to be able to do interesting tasks.
It is not a critical part of anything, so you can fiddle with it and just throw it away.  Say you want to
start configuring a database node.  You launch and login to a ControlNode and then try to install a database
(for example Maria).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the seventh installment of describing a radically more productive development and delivery environment.</p>

<p>The first part is here: <a href="/blog/add-1/">Intro</a>.  In the previous parts I described the big picture, Vagrant and EC2,
node initialization, the one minute configuration HeartBeat, HipChat integration, and presence.</p>

<h2>Fuller Presence and EC2 Integration</h2>

<p>In the previous part, I went through a very simple but powerful model of &#8216;presence&#8217; using simply GitHub repositories.
The content of those presence statements was enough to figure out what nodes exist, but not much more about them.
The second level of presence is to update the state of the node as it changes.  For example, a node goes through
a few bootstrap steps:</p>

<ul>
<li> presetup – The node before any updates are possible (no ability to change status)</li>
<li> setup – The beginning of the &#8216;setup&#8217; phase where the node is alive enough to change it&#8217;s status</li>
<li> initdone – The time a node is done are initialization and can start doing &#8216;work&#8217; as the &#8216;nodepart&#8217; it is</li>
</ul>


<p>A node getting to &#8216;setup&#8217; is pretty important: before that it may be a zombie!  And we don&#8217;t want zombie&#8217;s in
our federation!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the sixth installment of describing a radically more productive development and delivery environment.</p>

<p>The first part is here: <a href="/blog/add-1/">Intro</a>.  In the previous parts I described the big picture, Vagrant and EC2,
node initialization, the one minute configuration HeartBeat, and HipChat integration.</p>

<h2>&#8216;Part&#8217; Provisioning</h2>

<p>Each node plays a singular &#8216;Part&#8217;.  A &#8216;part&#8217; is a unique combination of roles (in the chef sense) that identifies
exactly how the node should be provisioned, usually globally, but at least for each stacktype.  A standard array
of parts would be the LAMP stack:</p>

<ul>
<li> Load Balancer (lb)</li>
<li> Application Server (app)</li>
<li> Database Server  (db)</li>
</ul>

<p>The first part is here: <a href="/blog/add-1/">Intro</a>.  In the previous parts I described the big picture, Vagrant and EC2,
node initialization, and the one minute configuration HeartBeat.</p>

<h2>HipChat</h2>

<p>The fourth ingredient to the ADD is HipChat.  HipChat is meant to help people communicate and see the state of the world.
It is an excellent communication program with a plethora of integrations.  But for ADD the critical capability is
to mix notifications of machines with communication between people.  You can also have it be used to drive the ADD
system (kind of like a command line) but that isn&#8217;t very important since it would just make changes in GitHub
which can be made in lots of different ways.</p>

<p>The demo of this is very simple:</p>

<p>The first part is here: <a href="/blog/add-1/">Intro</a>.  In the previous parts I described the big picture and the Vagrant and EC2 bootstrap.</p>

<h2>Node initialization</h2>

<p>The previous parts described getting Vagrant and EC2 to have an operational node.  For Vagrant it leverages &#8216;host&#8217; virtual
disk access to configure and bootstrap itself.  For EC2, it leverages CloudFormation to configure and bootstrap itself.
In both cases the very last thing the node does in the bootstrap is:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the third installment of describing a radically more productive development and delivery environment.</p>

<p>The first part is here: <a href="/blog/add-1/">Intro</a>.  In the previous parts I described the big picture and the
first part of the Vagrant bootstrap.</p>

<h2>EC2</h2>

<p>The Vagrant bootstrap occurred through &#8216;bash&#8217; files that shaped (put shape information into files) and
the &#8216;init&#8217; itself to get access to the repo (repo2) that contains the true configuration.  For EC2
the same thing happens within a CloudFormation template.  The code of the &#8216;init&#8217; is almost identical, but because
it is in a JSON file there is a lot of noise as the string gets concatenated together.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the second installment of describing a radically more productive development and delivery environment.</p>

<p>The first part is here: <a href="/blog/add-1/">Intro</a>, but to summarize: since the 1970s, the most productive way
to develop and deliver software was present in Smalltalk, Lisp, and other languages (Mesa/Cedar at Xerox)
by using a very simple and powerful model.  You take a computer with a fully running environment, you tweak it,
and then you clone that.  This way you: (a) minimize what could go wrong, and (b) maximize what will continue to work.
It is very tangible and very instructive (you have full source for everything that is running).  You tweak other
people&#8217;s masterpieces until they do what you want, and you learn from their masterpieces to create your own.</p>

<h2>ADD: How Better?</h2>

<p>As described before, ADD has four ingredients:</p>

<ul>
<li>Amazon EC2 <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">http://aws.amazon.com/</a></li>
<li>Amazon S3  <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">http://aws.amazon.com/</a></li>
<li>GitHub.com <a href="http://github.com/">http://github.com/</a></li>
<li>HipChat    <a href="http://HipChat.com/">http://HipChat.com/</a></li>
</ul>


<p>And these are hooked together to enable &#8216;Changers&#8217;, &#8216;Watchders&#8217;, and &#8216;Machines&#8217; to be super-productive.  How
is the ADD <em>more productive</em> than the tweak and clone model?  It is because it solves the core problems
of the clone model:</p>

<ul>
<li>How do we clone to <em>different</em> environments?  Different hardware or configuration changes?</li>
<li>How do we reduce the amount of information we have to clone?</li>
<li>How do we reduce the time it takes to transport the clone?</li>
<li>How do we know what version of the clone is on any machine?</li>
<li>How do we create thousands of clones?</li>
<li>How do we know what is different about the different clones?</li>
<li>&#8230;</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been paid to develop and deliver software since about 1980.  That is 35 years of professional experience.
When I started in 1980 there were a lot of &#8216;old timers&#8217; who had been around since 1965 or so.  They were 15 years
ahead of me, and even after finishing college, I had less than ten years to their twenty or so.  This was both
intimidating but also very helpful: after college my main programming language was Smalltalk (ParcPlace, Digitalk, etc.),
which included full source to everything.  So the &#8216;masters&#8217; would write masterpieces of code, and I would read them.  And then
try to write my own beautiful things leveraging the masterpieces.  I was late to the party, but could learn quickly.</p>

<p>I also have one other unusual advantage: I do startups.  Lots of startups (<a href="http://SlumsOfPaloAlto.com/">http://SlumsOfPaloAlto.com/</a>).  A total of ten software startups over a period of
a bit more than a decade.  Each of these startups failed for one reason or another, but each one <em>hugely</em> progressed in
how good my development team ran.  Eight, nine, and ten were <em>crazy</em> productive: I would run production servers for the
whole company at the same time that I built out the product.  Alone.  And generally way faster than the product management
team could keep up.  At PeerCase the product team actually asked me to <em>slow down</em> delivery so they could ponder what
they wanted for longer.  I literally went to Disney World during ASH (a medical conference) to prevent myself from
releasing new features I knew they wanted.  I was paid to <em>not work</em> (well, I was contracting at the time, so I stopped the
hourly billing clock, but my project bonus was the same).</p>

<h2>10x Productivity</h2>

<p>Besides doing startups, I also consult for companies.  I try to help them improve their development methods, usually by at least 4x if not 10x.
A lot of times, people don&#8217;t believe you can improve things to &#8216;10x&#8217; the productivity of the current team using new
development and delivery techniques.  At one company, the CIO and a number of other executives believed me, but I had to convince
a lot more stakeholders.  So two amigos and I sent me into the trenches.  I started taking projects estimated as two-developers, six-months,
and doing them in one month.  Part time.  That is more than 12x productivity.  Realistically it was likely about 20x the productivity
because the teams tend to miss their estimates (they go over).</p>

<p>The previous post dealt with the groundwork of having Git be a central part of IT automation.  That
showed the core idea but was a bit too simple to fully express the power of the approach.
This post will be dealing with all the things that were left off, especially support for:</p>

<ul>
<li> Many different types of servers with both their own and shared &#8216;recipes&#8217;</li>
<li> More complicated install/upgrade actions</li>
<li> More sophisticated install behavior</li>
<li> Multiple versions of &#8216;recipes&#8217; and an ability to promote whole IT from development to production</li>
<li> Getting information from other active repositories</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the fourth in a series of using git as part of interesting solutions to problems.</p>

<p>The first is here: <a href="/blog/git-about-everything-intro/">Intro</a></p>

<h2>Leveraging git to help enable automated IT</h2>

<p>Doing IT for computers involves installing software, configuring things, doing backups, updates, etc.
The ultimate IT is one that <em>&#8216;simply works&#8217;</em> and involves almost no human interaction
even in failure situations.  Ideally IT should be equivalent to
a macro-level program that does everything that does not require touching
a physical machine.</p>

<p>This IT-as-program has become easier and easier over the last many years with
better and more standardized operating systems, free software that does not
require annoying human interaction during installation, and virtualization on top of physical
hardware that makes provisioning and reprovisioning easier.  With cloud computing,
IT-as-program becomes almost a necessity as hundreds of virtual computers are created, updated, failed,
migrated, and decommissioned.</p>

<p>Git alone doesn&#8217;t enable IT-as-program but it can be a core component in many areas.  Among these are:</p>

<ul>
<li> Easy &#8216;Live IT&#8217; servers</li>
<li> A Push-Me-Pull-You model for continual deployment</li>
<li> Server presence</li>
</ul>


<p>Having git as a core piece of IT infrastructure enables thousands of machines to very rapidly react (within a minute or two)
without needing a heavy infrastructure.  You simply need one or two (for redundancy) git servers, of which one can be GitHub
or a similar free or inexpensive service.  Other technologies in this space have significantly more complicated servers,
are more likely to be SPOFs (Single points of failures) or bottlenecks, and are much more expensive as a service.</p>
