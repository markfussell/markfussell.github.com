<div class="entry-content"><p>This is a series describing various architectures I have worked with in the last two decades and some of their
benefits and issues.  The table of contents of the series is <a href="/blog/arch-1">here</a>.</p>

<p>FooPets had several different products, but all were related to photorealistic virtual pets.</p>

<h2>Major System Aspects</h2>

<p>The core FooPets site was originally framed by Facebook with a small amount of HTML driving a Flash-based interactive game.
The server behind the Facebook content was a Ruby/Rails application with a few standard extensions initially running on a bare linux box.  No automated testing or other code-quality metrics.</p>

<p>For most kinds of software, the logic and user-interface are the hardest things to build.  But because FooPets was
effectively a 3-D movie / game, the content was actually the hardest thing to build: creating photorealistic 3-D pets
took a lot more people-power than making these photorealistic pets behave.</p>

<p>Later there were to be a couple more architectures:</p>

<ul>
<li>An iPhone version of the pets

<ul>
<li>This was purely client initially and then later semi-integrated with the server until the game was killed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C72spt5ZL44">HeartPark</a> truly 3-D interactive game (vs. canned limited videos).

<ul>
<li>The game ran in Unity and only talked to the server for leaderboards</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>AA-1 : Lack of promotions and regression testing is a very bad thing</h2>

<p>FooPets was a very unstable code base for many reasons, but definitely the lack of &#8216;make sure this works&#8217; was a huge
part of it.  Some team members had the ability to modify production directly, and they could do it even before getting
on a plane and disappearing for the holidays.  A promotion model looks like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Developer tests things on their own machine, and when happy, &#8216;promote&#8217; into the development team server</li>
<li>The development team server tests the new code checkin and sees whether it passes the base line rules for the server

<ul>
<li>If not, it rejects it or starts yelling &#8216;foul&#8217;!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When the development team is happy the development team server&#8217;s code base is good, it goes to the next level (QA, Integration, etc.)</li>
<li>Finally the last QA level is basically the same as production, and the final promotion should be trivial</li>
</ul>


<p>Without this kind of staging model, you are basically just praying production will be about the same as whatever machine you last tested on&#8230; potentially a developer laptop very different from production.</p>

<h2>AA-2 : Sanity testing and automation are very good things, in all kinds of situations</h2>

<p>When I joined FooMojo, I expected to work on the main code base and the iPhone application as the &#8216;most important&#8217; code bases.
These two code bases needed some work, but ultimately the long-pole for the company was <em>content</em>.  And creating content
required a lot of computational power rendering graphics, connecting images into movies, and similar activities that were
only semi-automated.  The biggest productivity improvement was when a few of us focused on making the whole pipeline pretty
much completely automated (with failures identified and easily re-run).</p>

<p>At thirty frames per second, a 10-minute set of clips has 18,000 frames that have to be rendered and composed.  The frames might have different kinds of issues,
but the most likely issue is they didn&#8217;t get rendered at all, which is pretty easy to identify.</p>

<p>So similar to DevOps where you apply software to computer operations, DevGraphics applies software and development techniques to
the graphics pipelines of movies and high-content games.</p>

<h2>AA-3 : Using advanced technology can make things very easy and impressive</h2>

<p>The concept for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C72spt5ZL44">HeartPark</a> started during the post-Christmas &#8220;break&#8221;, and
within less than two months, a fun game was in all users hands.  By combining the skills of a very small team with a very
advance technology (Unity 3D), we went from idea through prototype to live in a very short time.</p>

<p>Sometimes the technologies used could be considered &#8216;prototypical&#8217;: you could never support 1MM with them (say maybe hardware
compatibility issues).  But the importance of figuring out whether you have a viable product for a viable market and pivoting
as you do or don&#8217;t is far higher in value than getting the technology &#8216;perfect&#8217; the first time.  And even more fun: sometimes
the nonviable technology becomes mainstream enough to use by the time you have the right product for the right market.</p>

<h2>AA-4 : Make sure clients &#8220;always work&#8221; or Apple is smart about devices</h2>

<p>A critical rule to getting through the Apple AppStore process was making sure your application obeyed a bunch of rules.
Some of these rules were human-factor rules to make sure the product was pleasant and conformant with iOS.  But one of the
core rules was that applications <em>must work</em> even when the device was not in a suitable environment.  The application
could be thoroughly hobbled by the environment, but it must launch, interact with a user pleasantly, maybe explain
and resolve the situation, and shut down <em>no matter what</em>.  An application / client can&#8217;t fail without explanation or
really at all, it can only behave very restrictedly but properly.</p>

<p>This &#8220;always work&#8221; can then lead you to a decision tree around how well does a client in a degraded environment work.  It definitely must work, but how well?</p>
