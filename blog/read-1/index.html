<div class="entry-content"><p>This is the fourth series describing the ADD: a radically more productive software development and delivery
environment.  The first series starts here: <a href="/blog/add-1/">Advanced Development and Delivery</a> and described the core four ingredients
of the ADD.  The second series starts here: <a href="/blog/addstack-1/">ADD Stack</a> and described the application stack and
system components associated with the ADD.  Some of these were Java / Grails specific, and some were more general
components and capabilities.  Together these went through a huge amount of functionality, flexibility, reliability,
and scalability.  Both for the IT infrastructure (whether on EC2 or on bare hardware) and for the applications
on top of that IT infrastructure. The third series starts here: <a href="/blog/add2-1">Advanced Development and Delivery Summary</a>
and gave an executive summary of the ADD.</p>

<p>This series is about project estimation, and is basically <em>orthogonal</em> to the ADD itself.  You can have good
 estimates or bad estimates.  The ADD delivers exceptional productivity.  How much you need to estimate is
 quite independent of productivity.  But by using Estimation and Feedback, you can figure out (a) whether
 to do a project and (b) whether the people you have are up-to-snuff.  If you <em>know</em> you have to do
 a project and you <em>have</em> certain people: don&#8217;t worry about the estimate.  It is irrelevant.  Just &#8220;wing it&#8221;.
 But if you have choices about either (a) whether to do a project or (b) what people to use or even (c)
 figuring out how good your team is after you do a project, then estimations are the core benchmark to
 give you feedback.</p>

<h2>Estimation is crazy-hard</h2>

<p>The problem with estimating is you can&#8217;t be good at it unless you have done something very similar before.  But
most workers in an industry are relatively new to it: less than ten years.  And if each project takes a couple
years to complete, you may have only a couple experiences in your first five years of work.  Change technologies,
change roles, or change organization, and your estimates are likely poorly based.</p>

<p>When something is too hard for someone to do easily, you need to decompose it to make it (a) easier and (b) separable.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Doing two or more pieces sequentially is commonly easier than doing the whole task at one time.  By easier, I don&#8217;t
mean faster.  It may take more time, especially if there is some interrelationship between the pieces.  But there
is commonly a limit to how much a human brain can do at one time until they are trained.  Over time, the training
in the pieces enables them to be done simultaneously.  Master chefs and similar tend to be trained in all pieces of
  their craft until they can do it all so easily that they can do it simultaneously.</p>

<p>By making the pieces separable, you can have different people work on each of the pieces, and develop the skills
   needed for the piece.  Note that this isn&#8217;t &#8220;slicing&#8221; a large piece of work into a smaller piece of work which
   requires all the same skills.  That would be like a chef doing part of the dinner service.  Instead it is
   separating the skills needed: one chef &#8220;Plates&#8221; and just plates, another cooks meats, another cooks vegetables,
   another makes sauces, and so on.</p>

<p>The critical question is then how to decompose?  First we need to define and decompose what we mean by estimation.  And to do
that, we can put estimation into the macro solution-delivery process of software.</p>

<h2>A Framework: READ</h2>

<p>I have been reading and writing software for about 35,000 hours.  Mostly reading, which I believe is the core
to being a great programmer: read great programmers&#8217; code and you will learn from it.  It may be hard to find
great code to read, but you can always start with Smalltalk or find some epic system close to the
kinds of systems you build.</p>

<p>Working through possible acronyms for the bigger software development process, I stumbled upon my favorite word: &#8220;READ&#8221;.
All software is developed through this simple approach and acronym:</p>

<ul>
<li>Requirements – What is the problem, and what is your solution to that problem?</li>
<li>Estimation – What is the estimate of the <em>size</em> of the solution?  Note this is before any technology has been picked.  It is the functional size and not the delivery estimate</li>
<li>Architecture – What is the architecture and technology you want to use to deliver this solution</li>
<li>Delivery – Now deliver.  If this is a waterfall, deliver once.  If incremental, deliver in increments.</li>
</ul>


<p>And a bonus:</p>

<ul>
<li>Over – Now either be done or start over (if iterative) until the solution solves the real problem.

<ul>
<li>This requires &#8220;Delta&#8221; size estimation.  How much is being added to or modified about a system</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Estimation of Solution Size</h3>

<p>The hard part is doing Estimation of Solution Size without getting pulled into the details of architecture and delivery.  We are not
yet good at this as an industry.  We need a body of knowledge and a system to estimate the size of a solution
 independent of the architecture chosen and the team that delivers.  If we have this, we can finally <em>measure</em>
 something useful.  Actually we can measure <em>a lot</em> of useful things.</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the ROI of the solution?  If the solution is really big, there are very few architectures and delivery teams that are going to dramatically reduce the cost</li>
<li>How well do certain architectures do against a particular solution?  For a given delivery team, you can see what they are good at or not.  Going across delivery teams, you may be able to identify <em>better</em> architectures vs. <em>more familiar</em> to the team.

<ul>
<li>What are the differences between the architectures that cause these effects?</li>
<li>Should we change architectures or train more in an architecture?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How well do the delivery teams deliver?  Especially if the solution is about the same size, and the architecture is the same, you should start seeing better and worse results.

<ul>
<li>What are the differences between the teams that cause this effect?</li>
<li>Can we improve the numbers?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Estimation of solution size has been attempted with Function Points and more recently with COSMIC Function Points. I
think using the term &#8220;point&#8221; is not quite right, so I am going to recommend being more creative although just a
simple twist on the word.  I propose &#8216;joint&#8217; to capture complexity.  Things with more joints are usually more
complex, and it is relatively linear or even somewhat exponential as you increase the joint count.</p>

<h3>Joints</h3>

<p>So what should constitute a &#8216;joint&#8217;?  With very little effort in evaluating it (will be starting soone), I believe COSMIC
is a valid starting methodology.  So a COSMIC Point is a Joint.  Not much difference, but at least it splits the
  two issues: How big is it (1000 joints)?  How long is it expected to take to build it (10,000 points)?</p>
