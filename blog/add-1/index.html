<div class="entry-content"><p>I have been paid to develop and deliver software since about 1980.  That is 35 years of professional experience.
When I started in 1980 there were a lot of &#8216;old timers&#8217; who had been around since 1965 or so.  They were 15 years
ahead of me, and even after finishing college, I had less than ten years to their twenty or so.  This was both
intimidating but also very helpful: after college my main programming language was Smalltalk (ParcPlace, Digitalk, etc.),
which included full source to everything.  So the &#8216;masters&#8217; would write masterpieces of code, and I would read them.  And then
try to write my own beautiful things leveraging the masterpieces.  I was late to the party, but could learn quickly.</p>

<p>I also have one other unusual advantage: I do startups.  Lots of startups (http://SlumsOfPaloAlto.com/).  A total of ten software startups over a period of
a bit more than a decade.  Each of these startups failed for one reason or another, but each one <em>hugely</em> progressed in
how good my development team ran.  Eight, nine, and ten were <em>crazy</em> productive: I would run production servers for the
whole company at the same time that I built out the product.  Alone.  And generally way faster than the product management
team could keep up.  At PeerCase the product team actually asked me to <em>slow down</em> delivery so they could ponder what
they wanted for longer.  I literally went to Disney World during ASH (a medical conference) to prevent myself from
releasing new features I knew they wanted.  I was paid to <em>not work</em> (well, I was contracting at the time, so I stopped the
hourly billing clock, but my project bonus was the same).</p>

<h2>10x Productivity</h2>

<p>Besides doing startups, I also consult for companies.  I try to help them improve their development methods, usually by at least 4x if not 10x.
A lot of times, people don&#8217;t believe you can improve things to &#8216;10x&#8217; the productivity of the current team using new
development and delivery techniques.  At one company, the CIO and a number of other executives believed me, but I had to convince
a lot more stakeholders.  So two amigos and I sent me into the trenches.  I started taking projects estimated as two-developers, six-months,
and doing them in one month.  Part time.  That is more than 12x productivity.  Realistically it was likely about 20x the productivity
because the teams tend to miss their estimates (they go over).</p>

<p>Then for fun, I was sent into the trenches again but this time had to use <em>some</em> of their development methods.  Still way faster,
but back down to 10x or a bit better.  As the trenches became &#8220;less mine&#8221; and &#8220;more theirs&#8221; I would slow down more and more.
Eventually everyone tired of each other and the experiments stopped.</p>

<p>Bizarrely, this company that saw the 20x continues to use the slow, unreliable, method of development.  The workers may have
been scared that the company would only need one in ten of them if they changed to a better method.</p>

<h2>Development Stagnation</h2>

<p>Again, I have been doing this for 35 years.  My skill as a developer has improved over that time, and I now view myself as an &#8216;8&#8217;
where each increase from &#8216;0&#8217; represents a doubling of business productivity.  So I am 256 times as productive as a &#8216;0&#8217;, and 16 times
as productive as a &#8216;4&#8217;.  Stephen Wolfram, Bill Joy, and others are above me, but there are not a lot of people up there anymore.</p>

<p>Getting to be a &#8216;4&#8217; involves understanding how to program.  Getting to a &#8216;6&#8217; involves understanding business needs.  But getting to an &#8216;8&#8217;
involved an incredible / revolutionary change to how software is developed and delivered.  For most of my career, getting to an &#8216;8&#8217;
was not possible.  Or at least the scale had to be different (i.e. add 50% for each number vs. doubling).</p>

<p>The problem was that software development had made <em>absolutely no progress</em> for 40+ years.  &#8220;You lie!&#8221; people claim.  &#8220;We build software very
differently then we used to!&#8221; they say.  Yes, <em>some people</em> have made progress.  But it was people doing it wrong for 40+ years.  The
people who did it right (Xerox PARC, MIT&#8217;s Lisp group, Xerox El Segundo, Tektronics, etc.) were buzzing along happily with a 4-10x speed
of the rest of the industry.  For 40+ years, the best way to write software was to take a working computer and tweak it.
Then clone that. Voila: you have a new capability on all your computers.  Testing is trivial.  Demoing is trivial.  Fixing
is trivial.  Tweak.  Clone.  Repeat.  Smalltalk, Lisp Machines, Xerox Stars, and so on all used this model.  And they were
blazingly fast to develop on.  And to learn how to develop on.</p>
