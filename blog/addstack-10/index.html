<div class="entry-content"><p>This is the second series describing the ADD: a radically more productive development and delivery environment.  The
first article is here: <a href="/blog/addstack-1/">Intro</a> and described the truth and lies about developing software.
The second article dealt with &#8216;Testing&#8217;.  The third dealt with the application stack (Grails and other technologies).
The fourth discussed UI alternatives.  The fifth added some major aspects to the stack: Semi-Structured Data, Templates,
and Dual or Isomorphic scripting. The sixth discussed UI frameworks in a bit more detail and ended with an Angular vs.
Ember as a core choice.  The seventh went into logging, analytics, and monitoring of the running applications and nodes.
The eighth was an overview of Federation Components like caches, queues, payment services, and the like.  The ninth
was on a highly reliable, scalable, flexibly, and ultimately very simple worker model.</p>

<h2>WAR!</h2>

<p>Continuing with the worker model, we currently have a non-production Application Server running Grails:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://fed1-app1.aws.gaps2c.com:8080">http://fed1-app1.aws.gaps2c.com:8080</a></li>
</ul>


<p>It is running grails &#8216;interactively&#8217; and &#8216;off-source&#8217;.  This is fast for deployment, but it is missing a few
things that people usually want in production:</p>

<ul>
<li>Well-defined artifact that has been tested and can&#8217;t &#8220;just change&#8221;</li>
<li>A container environment that can provide certain resources to the application (e.g. monitoring)</li>
<li>Removal of having to understand the &#8216;building&#8217; technology from the running technology (JVM)</li>
<li>That production has as few technologies as possible, and is normally missing &#8216;compilers&#8217; so people can&#8217;t tweak behavior</li>
</ul>


<!--more-->


<p>The last item is (IMO) a bit paranoid, and there are better ways to make sure production is stable (tripwires and
logging).  And the third is probably unrealistic for anything but trivial debugging.<br/>
But the first two are certainly reasonable wants.  A lot of people are familiar with deploying wars and deploying
wars on Tomcat and other servers.</p>

<h3>Where&#8217;s the WAR?</h3>

<p>The first issue with changing from source deployment to war-based deployment is &#8220;Where is the WAR?&#8221; and
&#8220;How do I know it has changed?&#8221;.  As with the other weird primary ingredient approaches, the WAR is going to
be in an annexed repository.  And you can see that it changed by simply looking at whether the &#8216;git revision&#8217; of
the war has changed.  This approach gives incredible power and flexibility:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can have as many different versions of the application as you want.  They just each have to have their own &#8216;folder&#8217;</li>
<li>You can easily see which deployments are using which versions</li>
<li>Changing a deployment to use a different version involves copying a 50 byte hash vs. an actual WAR file</li>
<li>Getting the real file is a super-fast call to S3</li>
<li>Bootstrapping the initial version is the same as any other version, which makes it less likely to diverge and break</li>
</ul>


<p>The WARs should be in a different repository from the source for a number of reasons, but the main one being their
rules and rythms are very different.  But the structure of the repositories can be very similar to make it easy to see
the created artifacts.  Something like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/addstack-10/addstack10_war1.png" /></p>

<p>Note that the contents of the directory could be anything.  And actually a &#8216;trick&#8217; to making the upload much faster
is to use an exploded &#8216;war&#8217; vs. a normal &#8216;war&#8217;.  Why?  Because a WAR contains a bunch of jars that are all almost
 always <em>identical</em> between versions.  So although S3 has basically unlimited space, it is silly to waste it with
 a file that (although different) is 99% the same between each version.  For example, all the identical jars within this
 expanded war:</p>

<p><img src="/images/addstack-10/addstack10_war2.png" /></p>

<p>The trade is that you have a lot more files in the other folders.  Finally, you could do a hybrid where everything but
the lib folder is compressed.  To make the real war, your deployment process would uncompress and then re-WAR the contents.</p>

<p>The performance difference is dramatically different when working outside the EC2 grid, but is less so within that
grid.</p>

<h3>Who deploys what?  The Promotion model</h3>

<p>The deploying server needs to watch something so it can see a change that is relevant to it.  Production does not care
that there is a new QA build.  And QA may not care there is a new development build.  QA never creates its own build,
but it only cares when a development build is &#8220;Good enough to QA&#8221;.  This I call the promotion model.</p>

<p>For any given application:</p>

<ul>
<li>Automated builds occur <em>all the time</em> (whenever something changes) and each gets a unique identifier (e.g. 201)</li>
<li>Each build is then promoted through however many levels of inspection you want

<ul>
<li>If it passes muster</li>
<li>If it has not been superseded by another build</li>
<li>If not, it is ignored</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>With this model, you never <em>go backward</em>, which increases productivity a lot.  And your are continuously trying to
 <em>go forward</em>, which means you have very current information about where you are.  And this also increases productivity.
 Yes, in a pinch, you could see if a build <em>between</em> last success and most current can be promoted.  But that is
 impacting productivity so it should rarely be done.</p>

<p>This also implies there is no branching.  One source.  One set of builds based on that source.  That is not required
by this approach (branch source, new set of builds), but it is strongly encouraged because it again <em>wastes no energy</em>
and it is trivial to flip to a different &#8216;set of builds&#8217; when a branch/back-patch is required.  But the process is
very optimistic while also being very realistic (the world is where it is) and appropriately pessimistic
(you can&#8217;t promote through QA until you pass the automated tests).  Because machines embody the process, you
can&#8217;t subvert it without doing it <em>very conspicuously</em></p>

<p>To be promoted, you just have to be &#8216;copied&#8217; into the right destination.  Promotions are more an &#8216;it&#8217; than
a &#8216;development&#8217; activity, so they are structured under the &#8216;it&#8217; folder.  Each federation (and potentially part)
has it&#8217;s own versions of things.  If you are in &#8216;fed1&#8217; and want the &#8216;grails-petclinic&#8217; application on your
machine, you know where to look: &#8216;fed/fed1&#8217;.  The use of &#8216;common&#8217; vs. &#8216;stacktype&#8217; is mirroring the flexibility
 shown elsewhere.  You could have most deployments use &#8216;common&#8217; and have some override it.  Or most deployments override &#8216;common&#8217;
 but there is a default in case they don&#8217;t.</p>

<p><img src="/images/addstack-10/addstack10_promo2.png" /></p>

<h3>Who builds and deploys?  Custom Worker vs. Chores</h3>

<p>OK, so we need to build and deploy every time a particular repository changes.  We could do that monolithicly
and have no registry of the war being built (it just magically happens), or we could do that in two parts:</p>

<ol>
<li>Detect change in repository: create chore to build war</li>
<li>Detect chore and worker do chore</li>
</ol>


<p>The advantage of the second version is we can decompose figuring out what needs to be done from doing it, and we
also have better visibility and consistency in the process.  Although I like doing things incrementally, I don&#8217;t
think the increment (monolith) is notably simpler than the second, and this was meant to build on our Worker topic.</p>

<p>The critical question is actually &#8216;who is going to write the chore&#8217;.  We don&#8217;t want to have a bunch of chores
created by different workers who all recognized a change was done.  Fortunately, we already have a model for this
 with the &#8216;chore&#8217; ownership.  We need to describe a &#8216;trigger&#8217; in a way that is related to whatever has changed
 about the world, and then when trying to &#8216;create the chore&#8217; a worker first &#8216;creates the trigger&#8217;.  Once a trigger
 is created and &#8216;pushed&#8217;, there is no reason to create it again.</p>

<p>In this case, the trigger is pretty obvious to describe: a git repository went to a new version or specifically:</p>

<ul>
<li>repo3_miniature-ironman</li>
<li>551b86e42d&#8230;</li>
</ul>


<p>so if a trigger for that exists, don&#8217;t create another one.  Since this is a simple identification, we don&#8217;t need
the extra directory structure and can simply write a &#8216;.json&#8217; file into the appropriate time directory.  Note the
time should be the time of the &#8216;event&#8217;, not of when it was noticed.</p>
