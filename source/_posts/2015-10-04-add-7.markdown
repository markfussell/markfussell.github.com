This is the seventh installment of describing a radically more productive development and delivery environment.

The first part is here: [Intro](/blog/add-1/).  In the previous parts I described the big picture, Vagrant and EC2,
node initialization, the one minute configuration HeartBeat, HipChat integration, and presence.

## Fuller Presence and EC2 Integration

In the previous part, I went through a very simple but powerful model of 'presence' using simply GitHub repositories.
The content of those presence statements was enough to figure out what nodes exist, but not much more about them.
The second level of presence is to update the state of the node as it changes.  For example, a node goes through
a few bootstrap steps:

   * presetup – The node before any updates are possible (no ability to change status)
   * setup – The beginning of the 'setup' phase where the node is alive enough to change it's status
   * setup_done – The time a node is done are initialization and can start doing 'work' as the 'nodepart' it is

A node getting to 'setup' is pretty important: before that it may be a zombie!  And we don't want zombie's in
our federation!  Later we will add a logging part that has timestamps so if a machine is a zombie for too long
we will simply kill it and hope the next node comes up better.
