  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the second series describing a radically more productive development and delivery environment.  The
first article is here: <a href="/blog/addstack-1/">Intro</a> and described the truth and lies about developing software.
Basically, assuming you are doing everything in the first series, and are using relatively modern technologies
and techniques, the &#8216;language&#8217;, &#8216;framework&#8217;, &#8216;stack&#8217;, and &#8216;methodology&#8217; does not matter very much.
And how it matters has a lot to do with the development team and the customer.
Customer happiness is the ultimate goal, so if you are not making your customer happy, you should make incremental
adjustments (Educated Guesses) to do so.  And if you can not &#8220;continuously&#8221; deliver valuable products to the
customer, you need to figure out what is the bottleneck and get rid of it (e.g. google Throughput Accounting).</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Hey&#8230; you said testing wasn&#8217;t important&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>No, I said automated testing was not <em>necessary</em>.  At times it is not even <em>valuable</em>, but at other times it is.</p>

<p>There is no way to avoid &#8216;Testing&#8217; unless no one is going to use your product.  &#8216;Using&#8217; is &#8216;Testing&#8217;, so everything
useful is continuously tested.  You have one user, you have one tester.  A million users, a million testers.
So you can&#8217;t avoid testing you software.  You can only augment/change <em>who</em> or <em>what</em> tests your software.  There
 are a number of options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Users – Guaranteed unless you have none</li>
<li>Developers – Should, unless they are crazy.  Not &#8216;testing&#8217; your software is equivalent to not reading (and editing) what you wrote.</li>
<li>Product Management – Should, unless they are crazy or really confident in the development team.  Product management is the Customer and represents the Users.  They are supposed to know what the users want and need to verify the product is doing the right thing</li>
<li>Quality Assurance – Useful if they are really good at being a &#8216;Black Hat&#8217;.  This is a different skill from &#8216;Developing&#8217; and some people are very good at it

<ul>
<li>QA should report to Product Management in spite of having technical skills similar to software developers</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>You could have a few more kinds of people that are stake holders, but the above is the core sources.  These are
people who could know what the software is supposed to do, and then test whether it is doing it.  They have
different talents, different tolerance for failure, and different price-points (or time restrictions).  So choosing
the right balance is again a &#8216;Make Customer Happy&#8217; (given a particular budget) ratio of utilization.</p>

<h3>Automation</h3>

<p>The above lists people.  This is because people have to do the hard work of figuring out &#8216;What should it do?&#8217; and
&#8216;How do I tell it is doing it?&#8217;.  It is true there are some automated test generators&#8230; but they are a rare
and limited breed that do a little bit more than a &#8216;static typed&#8217; language would do.  The benefits for most project
are minimal.</p>

<p>So &#8216;automated testing&#8217; is rarely about generation, but more about repetition.  Doing a manual test over and over
by a human is much more expensive, time consuming, and failure prone to getting a computer to run a similar test
against software.  The problem is someone has to &#8216;spend time&#8217; writing the test.  And time is both money and delay.</p>

<p>But maybe the tests are (magically) free.  Are they worth it?  Are they valuable?  Possibly &#8220;No!&#8221;.
Testing does not make software better.
Testing just proves software does something that passes the test.  Just like in academics a student could
prep for the SAT but be bad at math, software can pass the test and be horrible.  Fragile.  Complex.  Incoherent.
And the tests themselves could be Fragile.  Complex.  Incoherent.  And Obsolete.</p>

<p>Automated tests are neither good nor bad.  Only good tests are good and bad tests are bad.  I have had products with
tens of thousands of great tests.  And very successful products with basically no tests.  And been on teams with
hundreds of horrible tests that made them go slower and produce a worse product than if they just threw all the
tests away.</p>

<h3>Automation with Frameworks</h3>

<p>Because testing can be useful, your frameworks should support it.  And should support it as <em>easily</em> as possible.
They should be easy to read.  Easy to write.  Easy to maintain.  Powerful.  And as much as possible be &#8220;from the outside&#8221;.</p>

<p>Strangely this last truth has been replaced by a lie:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;You should test each unit, each module, each integration, etc.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>It is a variant of the XP &#8216;test first&#8217; mentality.  And it is completely idiotic.  Because it makes you focus on
the &#8216;how&#8217; instead of the &#8216;what&#8217;.  Your customer does not care you wrote something in Java or C.  With Spring
or Netty.  MySQL or Mongo.  Object-Oriented or functional.  They want the food.
And they want it to taste good.  Everything about making that food <em>you</em> can care about, but <em>you</em> can&#8217;t be continuously
testing it or you are wasting your customers time and money.  Testing the knife before each cut.  Testing the pan to see if it is solid.  If something breaks you
might investigate why it broke and do a periodic check in the future.  But you <em>do</em> by <em>doing</em>, and not with a
fear of failing on each step of the way.  You are paid to <em>do</em> not to <em>be afraid</em>.  <em>Do</em>, <em>Fail</em>, <em>Learn</em>, <em>Do</em></p>

<p>I am not saying you can&#8217;t test a few things on the inside.  Sometimes I do that as I bring a system up so it is
obvious (a) whether it is working, and (b) how it is supposed to be working.  A little &#8216;extra documentation&#8217; beyond
the code itself.  But these are a limited set that covers a slice of the system, not the whole thing.</p>

<h3>Automation with Grails</h3>

<p>The team behind Grails leverages other technologies as much as possible when they work.  Among the best technologies
for automated testing in Spring / Java are:</p>

<ul>
<li> Grub</li>
<li> Spock</li>
</ul>


<p>So Grails leverages these and has testing built-in to the framework.  It automatically generates test stubs for Controllers
(the UI interaction classes) and Domain classes (Business Logic).  And it generates both integration and unit tests.
I prefer integration tests as they are the most &#8220;from the outside&#8221;, but all the different tests are useful in
different amounts (some are faster to run).</p>

<p>For our &#8216;petclinic&#8217;, it has a number of tests of two different kinds:</p>

<p><img src="/images/addstack-2/addstack2_grails1.png" /></p>

<h4>Spock / Unit-ty tests</h4>

<p><img src="/images/addstack-2/addstack2_grails2.png" /></p>

<h4>Grub / Integration tests</h4>

<p><img src="/images/addstack-2/addstack2_grails3.png" /></p>

<p>The separation of Unit and Integration is somewhat more complex than this because Spock especially has
the ability to be doing different kinds of tests.  But this basic idea is the above.</p>

<h4>When to run?</h4>

<p>So we have some tests in a nice testing framework.  Now the critical questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>When should we run them?  As much as possible without wasting people&#8217;s time.</li>
<li>Should they be run before deploying a new version?  If they are fast enough, sure.  If not, then something should &#8216;go live&#8217; <em>before</em> the tests.

<ul>
<li>I don&#8217;t mean &#8216;go live&#8217; to end users, but go live to a server where others can see it.  Just like the &#8216;fed1_app1&#8217; deployment.</li>
<li>And you can have another server that is &#8216;post-test&#8217; so it is gated by tests being successful.  It is more stable but slightly behind in time and version.  Say &#8216;fed2&#8217;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Should developers run tests before checking in?  If they want to and are nervous, sure.  Especially tests in the area they are touching.  But breaking &#8216;fed1&#8217; is not a big deal unless you walk away afterwards.  Break it.  Fix it.  Carry on.</li>
</ul>


<p>The tests for the &#8216;petclinic&#8217; are quite fast, so we might as well run them before deploying and let people know the status.  Returning to our deployment script:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the second series describing a radically more productive development and delivery environment.</p>

<h2>Review of the first series</h2>

<p>The first series starts here: <a href="/blog/add-1/">Intro</a> and ends here: <a href="/blog/add-11/">Voilà!</a>.  The bulk of the
series was describing how to combine four ingredients:</p>

<ul>
<li>Amazon EC2 <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">http://aws.amazon.com/</a></li>
<li>Amazon S3  <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">http://aws.amazon.com/</a></li>
<li>GitHub.com <a href="http://github.com/">http://github.com/</a></li>
<li>HipChat    <a href="http://HipChat.com/">http://HipChat.com/</a></li>
</ul>


<p>in a way that gives individuals and teams 4x or more productivity.  These resulting environment solves problems for
all three roles in a development team:</p>

<ul>
<li>Changers</li>
<li>Watchers</li>
<li>Machines</li>
</ul>


<p>And can be envisioned as so:</p>

<p><img width="432" height="414" src="/images/add-1/ADD_FourIngredients_ThreeRoles_mlf1a1.png" /></p>

<p>Along the way, the ingredients combined to make:</p>

<ul>
<li>Machines automatically launch and configure themselves, including hooking them up to each other (auto-wire)</li>
<li>Changes to IT roll out automatically to all the running machines.</li>
<li>Changes to the application roll out automatically to all the running machines.</li>
<li>Creating new environments to be as easy providing a simple parameter (e.g. &#8220;fed2&#8221;) to a CloudFormation</li>
<li>The whole thing working on EC2 or inside a Vagrant container&#8230; or even on bare metal (but that was not shown)</li>
<li>Incredible visibility into everything that happens within HipChat&#8230; for the whole team.</li>
</ul>


<p>By the end, we had machines tell us when they launched, when they were operational, when they were deploying a new
version, and whether that new version deployed successfully.</p>

<p><img src="/images/add-11/add11_autodeploy1.png" /></p>

<p>and finally, we had a running application at a human-usable URL:</p>

<p><img src="/images/add-11/add11_dns1.png" /></p>

<p>That could be scaled to any number of servers as load demands.</p>

<h2>Second series</h2>

<p>The above is the core of the ADD and enabling team productivity and customer visibility (even happiness)
to shoot through the roof.  It by itself is basically &#8216;complete&#8217;.  It is missing some details, nuances,
augmentation, and such.  But it alone is the core of a 4x productivity.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Complete! What nonsense!  Where are your automated tests!  How do you check for code quality!
What kind of programming language do you use!  And where is your description of Scrum, XP, Waterfall, etc. methodology
to use with this ADD?!!&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Ah&#8230; yes.  Over my <em>thirty five years</em> and estimated <em>thirty five thousand hours</em> of developing software,
I have encountered all these things.  I do have opinions
on a lot of these things.  Preferences.  Best practices.  You may be interested.  They matter.  A little.</p>

<p>How little?  Maybe&#8230; maybe&#8230; 2x.</p>

<h2>It&#8217;s Alive!</h2>

<p>We are close to having a viable semi-production environment running the latest version of our code, and with an incredible
capability of configuring, controlling, and being informed of that environment.  With the simple line:</p>

<h2>A good, opinionated, framework</h2>

<p>Back in 1972, Smalltalk became the first Object-Oriented Programming Language (Simula was Object-Based but there is a difference).
For decades this kind of language was &#8216;esoteric&#8217;.  It was like LISP or Prolog or APL: somehow exotic and inaccessible.
I was lucky: I had access to Smalltalk at Caltech.  I had access to lots of crazy expensive things at Caltech and that
made the exotic (e.g. making your own chips) into the mundane (e.g. made lots of chips, they were commonly broken,
had to be re-fabricated, and I eventually got bored with all that and moved a level up).</p>

node initialization, the one minute configuration HeartBeat, HipChat integration, presence, EC2, and configuring nodes.</p>

<h2>Using Presence for configuration</h2>

<p>So far, presence has been just information that &#8216;humans&#8217; consume.  It shows up on dashboards, in chat rooms, and so on,
but nothing has acted upon it.  Until now!</p>

<p>We have &#8216;app&#8217; and &#8216;db&#8217; nodes.  Clearly the &#8216;app&#8217; nodes need to find the &#8216;db&#8217; nodes or the app is not going to be
able to persist much.  The &#8216;db&#8217; here happens to be &#8216;Maria&#8217; but it could be anything from a single DB node to a
cluster of Riak nodes.  At the moment, I just want to get the information that a &#8216;db&#8217; node knows (&#8220;I exist!&#8221;, &#8220;My IP is this!&#8221;)
over to the &#8216;app&#8217; nodes so they can process it.</p>

<h3>It is already there?</h3>

<p>But wait?  All nodes have &#8216;repo4&#8217; for writing?  Don&#8217;t they already have everything in &#8216;repo4&#8217; for reading as well?</p>

<p>And so they do.  The presence information is already there waiting patiently for somebody or someboty to read it.</p>

<h2>Configuring Node Parts and even fuller Presence and visibility</h2>

<p>So far our node was a generic &#8216;ControlNode&#8217;.  A ControlNode is a node that is in your data center
(to be near the other nodes), similar to your actual nodes, and configured to be able to do interesting tasks.
It is not a critical part of anything, so you can fiddle with it and just throw it away.  Say you want to
start configuring a database node.  You launch and login to a ControlNode and then try to install a database
(for example Maria).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the seventh installment of describing a radically more productive development and delivery environment.</p>

<p>The first part is here: <a href="/blog/add-1/">Intro</a>.  In the previous parts I described the big picture, Vagrant and EC2,
node initialization, the one minute configuration HeartBeat, HipChat integration, and presence.</p>

<h2>Fuller Presence and EC2 Integration</h2>

<p>In the previous part, I went through a very simple but powerful model of &#8216;presence&#8217; using simply GitHub repositories.
The content of those presence statements was enough to figure out what nodes exist, but not much more about them.
The second level of presence is to update the state of the node as it changes.  For example, a node goes through
a few bootstrap steps:</p>

<ul>
<li> presetup – The node before any updates are possible (no ability to change status)</li>
<li> setup – The beginning of the &#8216;setup&#8217; phase where the node is alive enough to change it&#8217;s status</li>
<li> initdone – The time a node is done are initialization and can start doing &#8216;work&#8217; as the &#8216;nodepart&#8217; it is</li>
</ul>


<p>A node getting to &#8216;setup&#8217; is pretty important: before that it may be a zombie!  And we don&#8217;t want zombie&#8217;s in
our federation!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the sixth installment of describing a radically more productive development and delivery environment.</p>

<p>The first part is here: <a href="/blog/add-1/">Intro</a>.  In the previous parts I described the big picture, Vagrant and EC2,
node initialization, the one minute configuration HeartBeat, and HipChat integration.</p>

<h2>&#8216;Part&#8217; Provisioning</h2>

<p>Each node plays a singular &#8216;Part&#8217;.  A &#8216;part&#8217; is a unique combination of roles (in the chef sense) that identifies
exactly how the node should be provisioned, usually globally, but at least for each stacktype.  A standard array
of parts would be the LAMP stack:</p>

<ul>
<li> Load Balancer (lb)</li>
<li> Application Server (app)</li>
<li> Database Server  (db)</li>
</ul>

<h2>HipChat</h2>

<p>The fourth ingredient to the ADD is HipChat.  HipChat is meant to help people communicate and see the state of the world.
It is an excellent communication program with a plethora of integrations.  But for ADD the critical capability is
to mix notifications of machines with communication between people.  You can also have it be used to drive the ADD
system (kind of like a command line) but that isn&#8217;t very important since it would just make changes in GitHub
which can be made in lots of different ways.</p>

<p>The demo of this is very simple:</p>

<p>The first part is here: <a href="/blog/add-1/">Intro</a>.  In the previous parts I described the big picture and the Vagrant and EC2 bootstrap.</p>

<h2>Node initialization</h2>

<p>The previous parts described getting Vagrant and EC2 to have an operational node.  For Vagrant it leverages &#8216;host&#8217; virtual
disk access to configure and bootstrap itself.  For EC2, it leverages CloudFormation to configure and bootstrap itself.
In both cases the very last thing the node does in the bootstrap is:</p>
