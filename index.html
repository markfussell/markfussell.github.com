  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the second installment of describing a radically more productive development and delivery environment.</p>

<p>The first part is here: <a href="/blog/add-1/">Intro</a>, but to summarize: since the 1970s, the most productive way
to develop and deliver software was present in Smalltalk, Lisp, and other languages (Mesa/Cedar at Xerox)
by using a very simple and powerful model.  You take a computer with a fully running environment, you tweak it,
and then you clone that.  This way you: (a) minimize what could go wrong, and (b) maximize what will continue to work.
It is very tangible and very instructive (you have full source for everything that is running).  You tweak other
people&#8217;s masterpieces until they do what you want, and you learn from their masterpieces to create your own.</p>

<h2>ADD: How Better?</h2>

<p>As described before, ADD has four ingredients:</p>

<ul>
<li>Amazon EC2 <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">http://aws.amazon.com/</a></li>
<li>Amazon S3  <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">http://aws.amazon.com/</a></li>
<li>GitHub.com <a href="http://github.com/">http://github.com/</a></li>
<li>HipChat    <a href="http://HipChat.com/">http://HipChat.com/</a></li>
</ul>


<p>And these are hooked together to enable &#8216;Changers&#8217;, &#8216;Watchders&#8217;, and &#8216;Machines&#8217; to be super-productive.  How
is the ADD <em>more productive</em> than the tweak and clone model?  It is because it solves the core problems
of the clone model:</p>

<ul>
<li>How do we clone to <em>different</em> environments?  Different hardware or configuration changes?</li>
<li>How do we reduce the amount of information we have to clone?</li>
<li>How do we reduce the time it takes to transport the clone?</li>
<li>How do we know what version of the clone is on any machine?</li>
<li>How do we create thousands of clones?</li>
<li>How do we know what is different about the different clones?</li>
<li>&#8230;</li>
</ul>


<p>The first three ingredients are the most powerful and enables a fantastic improvement to the tweak and clone model.
The last ingredient is mainly for people to be able to enjoy the ADD more easily.  It is like the &#8216;salt-to-taste&#8217;
and how much you integrate HipChat in with the rest of the ecosystem is up to your team.  But the more it is integrated,
the more your team will know what is going on, the more easily your team will solve problems/issues, and the more easily
you will onboard new people.</p>

<h2>ADD: GitHub</h2>

<p>GitHub will become your primary resource for <em>everything</em> related to &#8216;information&#8217;.  Human notes&#8230; go into GitHub
in Markdown format (like this blog).  Meeting notes.  GitHub.  Images to go with Meeting notes.  GitHub.  Your first,
most important, repository will be called &#8216;repo1&#8217; and will be all the notes you want the team to see.  No more
arguing about the best Wiki, blogger, file store, etc.  The answer will always be the same.  It is in GitHub.  Because
<em>everything</em> is in GitHub.</p>

<p>Why?  Because it is simple.  It is accessible.  It is powerful.  Keeps history.  Takes almost no space.
It works offline (on an airplane).  And it works with multiple writers.  And if GitHub dies&#8230;
you have a complete copy of everything you need to bring up your own &#8216;Git&#8217;.  Asking &#8216;Why?&#8217; is silly.  First
move to GitHub for all of this, and then ask &#8216;Why?&#8217; to everything else.</p>

<h2>ADD: S3 : Annexed Repositories</h2>

<p>Git and GitHub are not good with large binary assets.  They get stored in a notably raw way and just make the
repository huge for no benefit.  So don&#8217;t store large binary assets in GitHub.  Instead store a reference to
the binary object up in S3.  Retrieve it as needed.  See <a href="/blog/git-about-everything-annex">Annex</a></p>

<h2>ADD: EC2 and Vagrant</h2>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been paid to develop and deliver software since about 1980.  That is 35 years of professional experience.
When I started in 1980 there were a lot of &#8216;old timers&#8217; who had been around since 1965 or so.  They were 15 years
ahead of me, and even after finishing college, I had less than ten years to their twenty or so.  This was both
intimidating but also very helpful: after college my main programming language was Smalltalk (ParcPlace, Digitalk, etc.),
which included full source to everything.  So the &#8216;masters&#8217; would write masterpieces of code, and I would read them.  And then
try to write my own beautiful things leveraging the masterpieces.  I was late to the party, but could learn quickly.</p>

<p>I also have one other unusual advantage: I do startups.  Lots of startups (<a href="http://SlumsOfPaloAlto.com/">http://SlumsOfPaloAlto.com/</a>).  A total of ten software startups over a period of
a bit more than a decade.  Each of these startups failed for one reason or another, but each one <em>hugely</em> progressed in
how good my development team ran.  Eight, nine, and ten were <em>crazy</em> productive: I would run production servers for the
whole company at the same time that I built out the product.  Alone.  And generally way faster than the product management
team could keep up.  At PeerCase the product team actually asked me to <em>slow down</em> delivery so they could ponder what
they wanted for longer.  I literally went to Disney World during ASH (a medical conference) to prevent myself from
releasing new features I knew they wanted.  I was paid to <em>not work</em> (well, I was contracting at the time, so I stopped the
hourly billing clock, but my project bonus was the same).</p>

<h2>10x Productivity</h2>

<p>Besides doing startups, I also consult for companies.  I try to help them improve their development methods, usually by at least 4x if not 10x.
A lot of times, people don&#8217;t believe you can improve things to &#8216;10x&#8217; the productivity of the current team using new
development and delivery techniques.  At one company, the CIO and a number of other executives believed me, but I had to convince
a lot more stakeholders.  So two amigos and I sent me into the trenches.  I started taking projects estimated as two-developers, six-months,
and doing them in one month.  Part time.  That is more than 12x productivity.  Realistically it was likely about 20x the productivity
because the teams tend to miss their estimates (they go over).</p>

<p>The previous post dealt with the groundwork of having Git be a central part of IT automation.  That
showed the core idea but was a bit too simple to fully express the power of the approach.
This post will be dealing with all the things that were left off, especially support for:</p>

<ul>
<li> Many different types of servers with both their own and shared &#8216;recipes&#8217;</li>
<li> More complicated install/upgrade actions</li>
<li> More sophisticated install behavior</li>
<li> Multiple versions of &#8216;recipes&#8217; and an ability to promote whole IT from development to production</li>
<li> Getting information from other active repositories</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the fourth in a series of using git as part of interesting solutions to problems.</p>

<p>The first is here: <a href="/blog/git-about-everything-intro/">Intro</a></p>

<h2>Leveraging git to help enable automated IT</h2>

<p>Doing IT for computers involves installing software, configuring things, doing backups, updates, etc.
The ultimate IT is one that <em>&#8216;simply works&#8217;</em> and involves almost no human interaction
even in failure situations.  Ideally IT should be equivalent to
a macro-level program that does everything that does not require touching
a physical machine.</p>

<p>This IT-as-program has become easier and easier over the last many years with
better and more standardized operating systems, free software that does not
require annoying human interaction during installation, and virtualization on top of physical
hardware that makes provisioning and reprovisioning easier.  With cloud computing,
IT-as-program becomes almost a necessity as hundreds of virtual computers are created, updated, failed,
migrated, and decommissioned.</p>

<p>Git alone doesn&#8217;t enable IT-as-program but it can be a core component in many areas.  Among these are:</p>

<ul>
<li> Easy &#8216;Live IT&#8217; servers</li>
<li> A Push-Me-Pull-You model for continual deployment</li>
<li> Server presence</li>
</ul>


<p>Having git as a core piece of IT infrastructure enables thousands of machines to very rapidly react (within a minute or two)
without needing a heavy infrastructure.  You simply need one or two (for redundancy) git servers, of which one can be GitHub
or a similar free or inexpensive service.  Other technologies in this space have significantly more complicated servers,
are more likely to be SPOFs (Single points of failures) or bottlenecks, and are much more expensive as a service.</p>

<h2>Leveraging git to help with IT tasks</h2>

<p>Doing IT for computers involves installing software, configuring things, doing backups, updates, etc.
Git can help out with a lot of this, with several big benefits.  Some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li> IT changes should always be version controlled in case of mistake.  Git and a couple patterns/tools makes that easy</li>
<li> Installing software can frequently be done with &#8216;yum&#8217; and similar commands, but some software needs a package, and some times you want more direct &#8216;this version&#8217; control.  An annexed git repository helps with that</li>
<li> Doing backups or other kinds of off-lining with an annexed repo is very simple and flexible</li>
<li> Git enables a PushMePullYou model that is very flexible and capable of driving hundreds of machines to do either (or both) very light and very heavy-weight operation</li>
</ul>


<p>Some of these things can be done with other tools, but I have found an annexed git repository to make doing these things easier and better</p>

<p>The first is here: <a href="/blog/git-about-everything-intro/">Intro</a></p>

<h2>Dealing with Binary Files</h2>

<p>As mentioned in the first posting, git and similar DVCS have issues with binary files.  Adding 100s of 10MB files, or 100s of
versions of 10MB files will produce gigabytes worth of data that must be cloned by everyone using the repository.  How do we avoid this?</p>

<p>There are a number of solutions in this space out there with differing characteristics, but the core approach is usually similar:
&#8220;Don&#8217;t store it in git&#8221;.  Instead we want to record enough information to retrieve the binary files from somewhere else.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are times when a new technology comes along, that at first appears to be pretty similar to
existing technology, but certain characteristics make for radically different or just nicely new solutions.
A recent example of this is &#8216;git&#8217; and similar distributed version control systems (DVCS).  They may
at first appear to be an interesting version of centralized version/content management systems, but
they are really much more&#8230; a core piece of technology useful for many things.</p>

<p>This is a series about how to use git to solve many different problems, some obvious and some more unusual.
I hope a few of them are interesting to readers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> is a visual programming language, but it might usefully have a textual version as well.
Scratch in it&#8217;s graphical form can verify syntax intuitively &amp; automatically, and the resulting graphics are definitely beautiful, but it took quite some effort to produce

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of my favored books in the 1980s was ‘A Taste of Smalltalk’. This was a very short book that gave you the flavor of Smalltalk programming (the language and IDE) as compared to Pascal, C, and Lisp. I believe it is always important to show multiple programming languages for concepts and this book followed that rule. The goal of this post-series is to take ‘A Taste of Smalltalk’ and apply it to Scratch (a visual programming language).  This is the third of my comparisons in this series, where the first one was in Ruby.</p>
