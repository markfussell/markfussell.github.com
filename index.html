  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the tenth installment of describing a radically more productive development and delivery environment.</p>

<p>The first part is here: <a href="/blog/add-1/">Intro</a>.  In the previous parts I described the big picture, Vagrant and EC2,
node initialization, the one minute configuration HeartBeat, HipChat integration, presence, EC2, configuring nodes, and inter-machine presence.</p>

<h2>A good, working, opinionated, framework</h2>

<p>Back in 1972, Smalltalk became the first Object-Oriented Programming Language (Simula was Object-Based but there is a difference).
For decades this kind of language was &#8216;esoteric&#8217;.  It was like LISP or Prolog or APL: somehow exotic and inaccessible.
I was lucky: I had access to Smalltalk at Caltech.  I had access to lots of crazy expensive things at Caltech and that
made the exotic (e.g. making your own chips) into the mundane (e.g. made lots of chips, they were commonly broken,
had to be re-fabricated, and I eventually got bored with all that and moved a level up).</p>

<p>But back to the language of Smalltalk.  The problem with Smalltalk is that it appears to be a language when it is
actually a computer. &#8216;C&#8217; was a language.  It made programs. &#8216;Pascal&#8217;, &#8216;Lisp&#8217; (sans Machine), &#8216;Fortan&#8217;, and so on&#8230;
they were all languages.  Smalltalk <em>contains</em> a language.  It is named Smalltalk (darn).  But Smalltalk-80 was not
<em>just</em> a language, it was an <em>entire running operating system with applications and full source</em>  It could boot on
most any machine that you made the &#8216;bootstrap&#8217; code work on.  To make a new Smalltalk-80 machine, you cloned either
the primordial Smalltalk-80 &#8216;image&#8217; from PARC, or you cloned your own modified &#8216;image&#8217;.  And by &#8216;image&#8217; this is
basically the same concept as cloning a disk&#8230; bit by bit identical copy that happens to be on a different disk / computer.</p>

<p>Eventually OOP became mainstream with Java, C++, Objective-C, Ruby, Python, and the like.  So people thought they
were getting the &#8220;Smalltalk&#8221; (or LISP Machine) benefits.  But they left out the &#8216;computer&#8217; that went with the language.</p>

<h3>Why opinionated?</h3>

<p>The Smalltalk computer was quite functional and thoroughly opinionated.  It <em>already did</em> a bunch of things and showed
you how it did them.  It wasn&#8217;t opinionated like a human usually uses the term: &#8220;You should build that house out of bricks, not straw&#8221;.
It was opinionated like the planet is: &#8220;I have already created lots of flora and fauna&#8230; please use them wisely&#8221;.  Even
how humans on the planet are: &#8220;We have already created plenty of roads&#8230; please use them instead of driving through yards&#8221;</p>

<p>Opinionated is basically a synonym for &#8220;Working&#8221;.  Smalltalk computers &#8220;worked&#8221; so don&#8217;t break it.  They work, so you
should probably copy them for anything similar.  And they work, so you might want to study how they work even if you
are going to be creative later.</p>

<h3>Modern &#8216;working&#8217; frameworks</h3>

<p>Early frameworks (say for Java) &#8216;kind-of-worked&#8217;.  They didn&#8217;t fully work, but you could &#8216;configure&#8217; them to work.
That is like getting all &#8216;IKEA&#8217; furniture for your house.  You could easily build it wrong.  It could not work
together.  Yes, you get to &#8216;tweak&#8217; it, but if someone simply offered &#8220;a furnished house&#8221; you would save a lot of
time and leverage their full sense of design.  Or you could go to a different furnished house that more closely matched your tastes.</p>

<p>The later fully-working / opinionated frameworks (like Ruby/Rails) truly worked out of the box.  They would come up with a UI, Business/Domain
layer, and a Database layer.  You could add things to the UI and it would go down the whole stack.  Add things to the database
or Domain, and it would bubble up/down.  For the framework to do these things it had to have a model for what software (in its full form)
looks like.  These frameworks had patterns/templates/rules for building things at command.  This isn&#8217;t quite as good as Smalltalk (&#8220;it already exists&#8221;)
but it is getting close, especially with sample applications available.
It also gets rid of the one problem / hurdle with Smalltalk full-computers: you had to strip them
of things you didn&#8217;t want customers to see / use / clone.</p>

<h3>Languages</h3>

<p>There are many modern languages.  They are mostly quite similar and boring in the language themselves.  The community around the
language makes much more of a difference, and the libraries / frameworks that exist based on that community&#8217;s interest.</p>

<p>I mentioned that I switched to Java pretty early on, which cost me productivity.  But I wanted the community and their
libraries.  Java was popular enough that it had multiple communities associated with it.  Some were crazy stupid and
created things (even tried to mandate use of things) that were completely stupid.  But other communities continued
to plug along and evolve libraries and frameworks that are better than you can get in other languages.  On the whole,
I believe the Java ecosystem is by far the best &#8216;hub&#8217; to build most custom development and to pair
with other tools/components in other languages.  And by Java, I mean Java, Groovy, and potentially other JVM-targeting
languages.  The less Java-like the language, the less likely I would consider it acceptably an &#8216;other&#8217;.</p>

<h3>Framework</h3>

<p>I believe the best (general) application framework in Java is Grails, which lives on top of the Spring stack.  It is
very mature and has good minds in the drivers seat.  It gets simpler and more powerful every generation.  If Spring
does something right, Grails simply uses it.  If not, Grails augments it.  Very rational.  Very powerful.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the ninth installment of describing a radically more productive development and delivery environment.</p>

<p>The first part is here: <a href="/blog/add-1/">Intro</a>.  In the previous parts I described the big picture, Vagrant and EC2,
node initialization, the one minute configuration HeartBeat, HipChat integration, presence, EC2, and configuring nodes.</p>

<h2>Using Presence for configuration</h2>

<p>So far, presence has been just information that &#8216;humans&#8217; consume.  It shows up on dashboards, in chat rooms, and so on,
but nothing has acted upon it.  Until now!</p>

<p>We have &#8216;app&#8217; and &#8216;db&#8217; nodes.  Clearly the &#8216;app&#8217; nodes need to find the &#8216;db&#8217; nodes or the app is not going to be
able to persist much.  The &#8216;db&#8217; here happens to be &#8216;Maria&#8217; but it could be anything from a single DB node to a
cluster of Riak nodes.  At the moment, I just want to get the information that a &#8216;db&#8217; node knows (&#8220;I exist!&#8221;, &#8220;My IP is this!&#8221;)
over to the &#8216;app&#8217; nodes so they can process it.</p>

<h3>It is already there?</h3>

<p>But wait?  All nodes have &#8216;repo4&#8217; for writing?  Don&#8217;t they already have everything in &#8216;repo4&#8217; for reading as well?</p>

<p>And so they do.  The presence information is already there waiting patiently for somebody or someboty to read it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the eighth installment of describing a radically more productive development and delivery environment.</p>

<p>The first part is here: <a href="/blog/add-1/">Intro</a>.  In the previous parts I described the big picture, Vagrant and EC2,
node initialization, the one minute configuration HeartBeat, HipChat integration, presence, and EC2 integration.</p>

<h2>Configuring Node Parts and even fuller Presence and visibility</h2>

<p>So far our node was a generic &#8216;ControlNode&#8217;.  A ControlNode is a node that is in your data center
(to be near the other nodes), similar to your actual nodes, and configured to be able to do interesting tasks.
It is not a critical part of anything, so you can fiddle with it and just throw it away.  Say you want to
start configuring a database node.  You launch and login to a ControlNode and then try to install a database
(for example Maria).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the seventh installment of describing a radically more productive development and delivery environment.</p>

<p>The first part is here: <a href="/blog/add-1/">Intro</a>.  In the previous parts I described the big picture, Vagrant and EC2,
node initialization, the one minute configuration HeartBeat, HipChat integration, and presence.</p>

<h2>Fuller Presence and EC2 Integration</h2>

<p>In the previous part, I went through a very simple but powerful model of &#8216;presence&#8217; using simply GitHub repositories.
The content of those presence statements was enough to figure out what nodes exist, but not much more about them.
The second level of presence is to update the state of the node as it changes.  For example, a node goes through
a few bootstrap steps:</p>

<ul>
<li> presetup – The node before any updates are possible (no ability to change status)</li>
<li> setup – The beginning of the &#8216;setup&#8217; phase where the node is alive enough to change it&#8217;s status</li>
<li> initdone – The time a node is done are initialization and can start doing &#8216;work&#8217; as the &#8216;nodepart&#8217; it is</li>
</ul>


<p>A node getting to &#8216;setup&#8217; is pretty important: before that it may be a zombie!  And we don&#8217;t want zombie&#8217;s in
our federation!</p>

<p>The first part is here: <a href="/blog/add-1/">Intro</a>.  In the previous parts I described the big picture, Vagrant and EC2,
node initialization, the one minute configuration HeartBeat, and HipChat integration.</p>

<h2>&#8216;Part&#8217; Provisioning</h2>

<p>Each node plays a singular &#8216;Part&#8217;.  A &#8216;part&#8217; is a unique combination of roles (in the chef sense) that identifies
exactly how the node should be provisioned, usually globally, but at least for each stacktype.  A standard array
of parts would be the LAMP stack:</p>

<ul>
<li> Load Balancer (lb)</li>
<li> Application Server (app)</li>
<li> Database Server  (db)</li>
</ul>

<p>The first part is here: <a href="/blog/add-1/">Intro</a>.  In the previous parts I described the big picture, Vagrant and EC2,
node initialization, and the one minute configuration HeartBeat.</p>

<h2>HipChat</h2>

<p>The fourth ingredient to the ADD is HipChat.  HipChat is meant to help people communicate and see the state of the world.
It is an excellent communication program with a plethora of integrations.  But for ADD the critical capability is
to mix notifications of machines with communication between people.  You can also have it be used to drive the ADD
system (kind of like a command line) but that isn&#8217;t very important since it would just make changes in GitHub
which can be made in lots of different ways.</p>

<p>The demo of this is very simple:</p>

<p>The first part is here: <a href="/blog/add-1/">Intro</a>.  In the previous parts I described the big picture and the Vagrant and EC2 bootstrap.</p>

<h2>Node initialization</h2>

<p>The previous parts described getting Vagrant and EC2 to have an operational node.  For Vagrant it leverages &#8216;host&#8217; virtual
disk access to configure and bootstrap itself.  For EC2, it leverages CloudFormation to configure and bootstrap itself.
In both cases the very last thing the node does in the bootstrap is:</p>

<p>The first part is here: <a href="/blog/add-1/">Intro</a>.  In the previous parts I described the big picture and the
first part of the Vagrant bootstrap.</p>

<h2>EC2</h2>

<p>The Vagrant bootstrap occurred through &#8216;bash&#8217; files that shaped (put shape information into files) and
the &#8216;init&#8217; itself to get access to the repo (repo2) that contains the true configuration.  For EC2
the same thing happens within a CloudFormation template.  The code of the &#8216;init&#8217; is almost identical, but because
it is in a JSON file there is a lot of noise as the string gets concatenated together.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the second installment of describing a radically more productive development and delivery environment.</p>

<p>The first part is here: <a href="/blog/add-1/">Intro</a>, but to summarize: since the 1970s, the most productive way
to develop and deliver software was present in Smalltalk, Lisp, and other languages (Mesa/Cedar at Xerox)
by using a very simple and powerful model.  You take a computer with a fully running environment, you tweak it,
and then you clone that.  This way you: (a) minimize what could go wrong, and (b) maximize what will continue to work.
It is very tangible and very instructive (you have full source for everything that is running).  You tweak other
people&#8217;s masterpieces until they do what you want, and you learn from their masterpieces to create your own.</p>

<h2>ADD: How Better?</h2>

<p>As described before, ADD has four ingredients:</p>

<ul>
<li>Amazon EC2 <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">http://aws.amazon.com/</a></li>
<li>Amazon S3  <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">http://aws.amazon.com/</a></li>
<li>GitHub.com <a href="http://github.com/">http://github.com/</a></li>
<li>HipChat    <a href="http://HipChat.com/">http://HipChat.com/</a></li>
</ul>


<p>And these are hooked together to enable &#8216;Changers&#8217;, &#8216;Watchders&#8217;, and &#8216;Machines&#8217; to be super-productive.  How
is the ADD <em>more productive</em> than the tweak and clone model?  It is because it solves the core problems
of the clone model:</p>

<ul>
<li>How do we clone to <em>different</em> environments?  Different hardware or configuration changes?</li>
<li>How do we reduce the amount of information we have to clone?</li>
<li>How do we reduce the time it takes to transport the clone?</li>
<li>How do we know what version of the clone is on any machine?</li>
<li>How do we create thousands of clones?</li>
<li>How do we know what is different about the different clones?</li>
<li>&#8230;</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been paid to develop and deliver software since about 1980.  That is 35 years of professional experience.
When I started in 1980 there were a lot of &#8216;old timers&#8217; who had been around since 1965 or so.  They were 15 years
ahead of me, and even after finishing college, I had less than ten years to their twenty or so.  This was both
intimidating but also very helpful: after college my main programming language was Smalltalk (ParcPlace, Digitalk, etc.),
which included full source to everything.  So the &#8216;masters&#8217; would write masterpieces of code, and I would read them.  And then
try to write my own beautiful things leveraging the masterpieces.  I was late to the party, but could learn quickly.</p>

<p>I also have one other unusual advantage: I do startups.  Lots of startups (<a href="http://SlumsOfPaloAlto.com/">http://SlumsOfPaloAlto.com/</a>).  A total of ten software startups over a period of
a bit more than a decade.  Each of these startups failed for one reason or another, but each one <em>hugely</em> progressed in
how good my development team ran.  Eight, nine, and ten were <em>crazy</em> productive: I would run production servers for the
whole company at the same time that I built out the product.  Alone.  And generally way faster than the product management
team could keep up.  At PeerCase the product team actually asked me to <em>slow down</em> delivery so they could ponder what
they wanted for longer.  I literally went to Disney World during ASH (a medical conference) to prevent myself from
releasing new features I knew they wanted.  I was paid to <em>not work</em> (well, I was contracting at the time, so I stopped the
hourly billing clock, but my project bonus was the same).</p>

<h2>10x Productivity</h2>

<p>Besides doing startups, I also consult for companies.  I try to help them improve their development methods, usually by at least 4x if not 10x.
A lot of times, people don&#8217;t believe you can improve things to &#8216;10x&#8217; the productivity of the current team using new
development and delivery techniques.  At one company, the CIO and a number of other executives believed me, but I had to convince
a lot more stakeholders.  So two amigos and I sent me into the trenches.  I started taking projects estimated as two-developers, six-months,
and doing them in one month.  Part time.  That is more than 12x productivity.  Realistically it was likely about 20x the productivity
because the teams tend to miss their estimates (they go over).</p>
