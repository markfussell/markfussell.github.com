  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the second series describing the ADD: a radically more productive development and delivery environment.  The
first article is here: <a href="/blog/addstack-1/">Intro</a> and described the truth and lies about developing software.
The second article dealt with &#8216;Testing&#8217;.  The third dealt with the application stack (Grails and other technologies).
The fourth discussed UI alternatives.  The fifth added some major aspects to the stack: Semi-Structured Data, Templates,
and Dual or Isomorphic scripting. The sixth discussed UI frameworks in a bit more detail and ended with an Angular vs.
Ember as a core choice.  The seventh went into logging, analytics, and monitoring of the running applications and nodes.
The eighth was an overview of Federation Components like caches, queues, payment services, and the like.  The ninth
was on a highly reliable, scalable, flexibly, and ultimately very simple worker model.</p>

<h2>WAR!</h2>

<p>Continuing with the worker model, we currently have a non-production Application Server running Grails:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://fed1-app1.aws.gaps2c.com:8080">http://fed1-app1.aws.gaps2c.com:8080</a></li>
</ul>


<p>It is running grails &#8216;interactively&#8217; and &#8216;off-source&#8217;.  This is fast for deployment, but it is missing a few
things that people usually want in production:</p>

<ul>
<li>Well-defined artifact that has been tested and can&#8217;t &#8220;just change&#8221;</li>
<li>A container environment that can provide certain resources to the application (e.g. monitoring)</li>
<li>Removal of having to understand the &#8216;building&#8217; technology from the running technology (JVM)</li>
<li>That production has as few technologies as possible, and is normally missing &#8216;compilers&#8217; so people can&#8217;t tweak behavior</li>
</ul>


<p>The last item is (IMO) a bit paranoid, and there are better ways to make sure production is stable (tripwires and
logging).  And the third is probably unrealistic for anything but trivial debugging.<br/>
But the first two are certainly reasonable wants.  A lot of people are familiar with deploying wars and deploying
wars on Tomcat and other servers.</p>

<h3>Where&#8217;s the WAR?</h3>

<p>The first issue with changing from source deployment to war-based deployment is &#8220;Where is the WAR?&#8221; and
&#8220;How do I know it has changed?&#8221;.  As with the other weird primary ingredient approaches, the WAR is going to
be in an annexed repository.  And you can see that it changed by simply looking at whether the &#8216;git revision&#8217; of
the war has changed.  This approach gives incredible power and flexibility:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can have as many different versions of the application as you want.  They just each have to have their own &#8216;folder&#8217;</li>
<li>You can easily see which deployments are using which versions</li>
<li>Changing a deployment to use a different version involves copying a 50 byte hash vs. an actual WAR file</li>
<li>Getting the real file is a super-fast call to S3</li>
<li>Bootstrapping the initial version is the same as any other version, which makes it less likely to diverge and break</li>
</ul>


<p>The WARs should be in a different repository from the source for a number of reasons, but the main one being their
rules and rythms are very different.  But the structure of the repositories can be very similar to make it easy to see
the created artifacts.  Something like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/addstack-10/addstack10_war1.png" /></p>

<p>Note that the contents of the directory could be anything.  And actually a &#8216;trick&#8217; to making the upload much faster
is to use an exploded &#8216;war&#8217; vs. a normal &#8216;war&#8217;.  Why?  Because a WAR contains a bunch of jars that are all almost
 always <em>identical</em> between versions.  So although S3 has basically unlimited space, it is silly to waste it with
 a file that (although different) is 99% the same between each version.  For example, all the identical jars within this
 expanded war:</p>

<p><img src="/images/addstack-10/addstack10_war2.png" /></p>

<p>The trade is that you have a lot more files in the other folders.  Finally, you could do a hybrid where everything but
the lib folder is compressed.  To make the real war, your deployment process would uncompress and the rewar the contents.</p>

<h3>Who deploys what?  The Promotion model.</h3>

<p>The deploying server needs to watch something so it can see a change that is relevant to it.  Production does not care
that there is a new QA build.  And QA may not care there is a new development build.  QA never creates its own build,
but it only cares when a development build is &#8220;Good enough to QA&#8221;.  This I call the promotion model.</p>

<p>For any given application:</p>

<ul>
<li>Automated builds occur <em>all the time</em> (whenever something changes) and each gets a unique identifier (e.g. 201)</li>
<li>Each build is then promoted through however many levels of inspection you want

<ul>
<li>If it passes muster</li>
<li>If it has not been superseded by another build</li>
<li>If not, it is ignored</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>With this model, you never <em>go backward</em>, which increases productivity a lot.  And your are continuously trying to
 <em>go forward</em>, which means you have very current information about where you are.  And this also increases productivity.
 Yes, in a pinch, you could see if a build <em>between</em> last success and most current can be promoted.  But that is
 impacting productivity so it should rarely be done.</p>

<p>This also implies there is no branching.  One source.  One set of builds based on that source.  That is not required
by this approach (branch source, new set of builds), but it is strongly encouraged because it again <em>wastes no energy</em>
and it is trivial to flip to a different &#8216;set of builds&#8217; when a branch/back-patch is required.  But the process is
very optimistic while also being very realistic (the world is where it is) and appropriately pessimistic
(you can&#8217;t promote through QA until you pass the automated tests).  Because machines embody the process, you
can&#8217;t subvert it without doing it <em>very conspicuously</em></p>

The eighth was an overview of Federation Components like caches, queues, payment services, and the like.</p>

<h2>Workers!</h2>

<p>Among the more interesting federation / deployment component are workers.  Workers are interesting because
they can do almost anything imaginable and they do it very efficiently.  How efficiently?  Well, the perfect
worker is at 100% when doing a task and <em>dead</em> when they have no tasks to do.  That is pretty darn efficient
because it approaches 100% and is only not 100% when we choose to not accept the &#8216;spin up&#8217; latency of getting
 a new worker.  As the amount of work increases, our pool of workers increase, and the spin-up-latency decreases
 on a per-chore basis.  That is <em>very cool</em>: as scale goes up, efficiency <em>increases</em>.  There are a lot of places that
 is not true for computers, so it is nice when it is.</p>

<h3>Work?  Chore?</h3>

<p>So we want to have a worker model where we can add a &#8216;chore&#8217; (a unit of work, using a term not otherwise used in
IT and CS&#8230; job, task, etc. are now ambivalent) to a queue of work-to-be-done, and have
 something do that chore.  There are a lot of ways to do this:</p>

<h2>Federation Application Infrastructure</h2>

<p>The application stack we have so far:</p>

<ul>
<li> UI (both client and server)</li>
<li> Application Server (Grails, Java, potentially scripting engine)</li>
<li> Database (Maria or similar)</li>
</ul>


<p>Is very capable.  Using it combined with the ADD ingredients:</p>

<ul>
<li> GitHub – With resource, presence, application, and configuration information repositories</li>
<li> EC2 Instances – Running continuously or based on load, and running their &#8216;part&#8217; plus any dynamic configuration</li>
<li> S3 – For resources</li>
<li> HipChat – To let everyone know</li>
</ul>


<p>Makes for a very functional application.  The nodes and their applications can talk to each other based on presence.
The nodes and their application can keep certain data in-memory (cached).  The nodes can
 launch other nodes to handle load or do certain tasks.  An Application Server is a very generic thing and
 can do pretty much anything.</p>

<h3>Standard Federation Components</h3>

<p>Doing pretty much anything and everything turns out to be very confusing.  For people.  Big monoliths of capabilities
are basically beyond comprehension.  And the bigger the monolith, the harder it falls.  The more likely it falls.
And even if you have redundant monoliths, the system becomes very painful to maintain and to learn.</p>

<h2>Logging, Analytics, and Monitoring</h2>

<p>Returning to a bit more of an &#8216;IT&#8217; issue, how do we handle logging, monitoring, and analytics on our collection of
machines?  There are a number of choices:</p>

<ol>
<li>Run our own infrastructure</li>
<li>Go with an inexpensive provider</li>
<li>Go with a more capable provider</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t</li>
</ol>


<p>Of the above, I believe #3 is usually worth it until your scale gets to the point of needing #1.  Downgrading
from #3 to #2 is fine <em>after</em> you have learned the capabilities you are giving up.</p>

first article is here: <a href="/blog/addstack-1/">Intro</a> and described the truth and lies about developing software.

The fourth discussed UI alternatives.  The fifth added some major aspects to the stack: Semi-Structured Data, Templates,
and Dual or Isomorphic scripting.</p>

<h2>Which UI framework?</h2>

<p>The <a href="/blog/addstack-4/">fourth article</a> discussed UI alternatives, but it was mostly about &#8216;architectural&#8217; alternatives
 and did not recommend a particular framework to use.  I believe that is the correct order: <em>how you use</em> the framework
 is usually more important than the framework itself.  People can correctly and improperly use all kinds of different technology.
Use a hammer correctly and you might have a slight penalty (rubber vs. metal), but
use it wrong (your thumb is targetable) and you can be seriously hurt.</p>

<p>There are a number of popular frameworks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Angular</li>
<li>Ember</li>
<li>Backbone</li>
<li>Sencha</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>


<p>And deciding between them may seem like it should be done as &#8220;which has the best features?&#8221; but unless
one of them has a killer feature  that you care about
(Sencha can run the same code with both a desktop and mobile UI), and is worth its penalties (Sencha
is proprietary and very &#8216;different&#8217;) then &#8216;best features&#8217; is basically meaningless.  A better question is &#8220;Which
one do I understand the best?&#8221; and &#8220;Which one can other people on the team learn and share-code the best?&#8221;.</p>

The second article dealt with &#8216;Testing&#8217;.  The third dealt with the application stack (Grails and other technologies).
The fourth discussed UI alternatives.</p>

<p>This article is about some fairly advanced capabilities, but capabilities that many projects find useful,
and so should be considered within the context of the overall context.  They are:</p>

<ul>
<li> Data Flexibility and Templating</li>
<li> Server Side Scripting</li>
</ul>


<h2>Data Flexibility and Template Systems</h2>

<p>One of the more interesting capability of an application is when users can control the content and presentation
of information.  Content is relatively easy given pure structured information is trivial to store in most
any database.  As the content becomes more unstructured you need to shift models and store it in a &#8216;meta&#8217;
structure like JSON.  As the content becomes bigger, you need the flexibility of very large objects (BLOBs and CLOBs)
stored either in the database or potentially within content repositories like S3.  Using the Annex model
discussed earlier, you can simply store a hash in the database and the actual content on S3, and then
<em>the client</em> can pull down the information without taxing your server network at all.</p>

<p>Having flexible data is not very useful unless you can present it.  If the data is in JSON, you need to
be able to take JSON and render it into text, HTML, or something the programming language can work with.
There are a number of template systems out there:</p>

<ul>
<li> Mustache</li>
<li> Jade</li>
<li> Dust</li>
</ul>

The second article dealt with &#8216;Testing&#8217;.  The third with the application stack (Grails and other technologies).</p>

<h2>User Interface</h2>

<p>Of all the technologies that change, the User Interface is by far the most diverse and most evolved.  Modern
databases are actually pretty old technology.  Modern languages are not significantly different from ancestors
in the 1970s.  Computers have the same main components.  Programmers interact with them with keyboards and screens.
If you picked well, you are programming better (tens of thousands of hours help) but are sadly
on pretty much the same core concepts you learned in your first five thousand hours.  Sigh.</p>

<p>Except.  Except the User Interface.  The implementation of user interfaces has grown since the 70s (the
first bit-mapped and mouse-based UIs were built way back then) through Smalltalk, Objective-C, Flash, Flex,
Angular, and other paths.  But even the devices have changed.  An iPhone is not a computer.  An Apple Watch
is not an iPhone.  Times they are a changing&#8230; at least for &#8216;devices&#8217;.</p>

<h3>It&#8217;s your face</h3>

<p>The User Interface is also the &#8216;face&#8217; of a company.  It sells the company.  Whether to new customers, existing
customers, employees, stock holders, or potential investors.  A web site like Rumble&#8217;s:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://rumblegames.com/">http://rumblegames.com/</a></li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/images/addstack-4/addstack4_ui1.png" /></p>

<p>And Rumble&#8217;s actual games are trying to appeal to a particular audience (middle aged men) and give
them something they want (to feel powerful and sophisticated).</p>

<p>A web site like PortaPlanter:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://PortaPlanter.com/">http://PortaPlanter.com/</a></li>

The second article dealt with &#8216;Testing&#8217;.</p>

<h2>Grails, Groovy, and Java</h2>

<p>The primary stack I believe is a &#8220;Best Practice&#8221; is Grails.  It is in it&#8217;s third full generation, and with
each generation it gets better, easier, more powerful, and more &#8216;aligned&#8217;.  This last part is not that
common with frameworks.  A lot of people start writing a framework and it does more and more.  With more and more
code.  The Grails team has been great at &#8216;pruning&#8217; and &#8216;aligning&#8217; with Spring and other frameworks.</p>

<p>Using Spring alone is certainly a reasonable practice.  The problem is people tend to use Spring wrong.  I don&#8217;t
know why.  Either they don&#8217;t read the tutorials&#8230; or they get confused and a deadline is approaching&#8230; or they
are cowboys (or cowgirls) that wander off into new territory of abuse to the tools that are in front of them.
I used Grails at a company that committed to Spring.  So I simply switched to Spring and my code was simple,
functional, well-tested, and clean.  But the rest of the code base was a complete mess.  So there is nothing
wrong with Spring but it is harder to use properly than Grails.  Spring Boot is trying to help with that.  Grails
is just better.</p>

<p>Grails is &#8216;opinionated&#8217; and &#8216;functional&#8217; and has plenty of examples to show you these opinions and capabilities.
We can see a lot of it in the &#8216;petclinic&#8217; example.</p>

<h3>Build with Gradle</h3>

<p>Grails uses Gradle to build the project.  It used to have it&#8217;s own system, but it pruned that away when Gradle
became stable and capable.  Gradle won a war against other build systems so Grails honored the winner.</p>

<h3>Align with Spring Boot</h3>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the second series describing the ADD: a radically more productive development and delivery environment.  The
first article is here: <a href="/blog/addstack-1/">Intro</a> and described the truth and lies about developing software.
Basically, assuming you are doing everything in the first series, and are using relatively modern technologies
and techniques, the &#8216;language&#8217;, &#8216;framework&#8217;, &#8216;stack&#8217;, and &#8216;methodology&#8217; does not matter very much.
And how it matters has a lot to do with the development team and the customer.
Customer happiness is the ultimate goal, so if you are not making your customer happy, you should make incremental
adjustments (Educated Guesses) to do so.  And if you can not &#8220;continuously&#8221; deliver valuable products to the
customer, you need to figure out what is the bottleneck and get rid of it (e.g. google Throughput Accounting).</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Hey&#8230; you said testing wasn&#8217;t important&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>No, I said automated testing was not <em>necessary</em>.  At times it is not even <em>valuable</em>, but at other times it is.</p>

<p>There is no way to avoid &#8216;Testing&#8217; unless no one is going to use your product.  &#8216;Using&#8217; is &#8216;Testing&#8217;, so everything
useful is continuously tested.  You have one user, you have one tester.  A million users, a million testers.
So you can&#8217;t avoid testing you software.  You can only augment/change <em>who</em> or <em>what</em> tests your software.  There
 are a number of options:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the second series describing the ADD: a radically more productive development and delivery environment.</p>

<h2>Review of the first series</h2>

<p>The first series starts here: <a href="/blog/add-1/">Intro</a> and ends here: <a href="/blog/add-11/">Voilà!</a>.  The bulk of the
series was describing how to combine four ingredients:</p>

<ul>
<li>Amazon EC2 <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">http://aws.amazon.com/</a></li>
<li>Amazon S3  <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">http://aws.amazon.com/</a></li>
<li>GitHub.com <a href="http://github.com/">http://github.com/</a></li>
<li>HipChat    <a href="http://HipChat.com/">http://HipChat.com/</a></li>
</ul>


<p>in a way that gives individuals and teams 4x or more productivity.  These resulting environment solves problems for
all three roles in a development team:</p>

<ul>
<li>Changers</li>
<li>Watchers</li>
<li>Machines</li>
</ul>


<p>And can be envisioned as so:</p>

<p><img width="432" height="414" src="/images/add-1/ADD_FourIngredients_ThreeRoles_mlf1a1.png" /></p>

<p>Along the way, the ingredients combined to make:</p>

<ul>
<li>Machines automatically launch and configure themselves, including hooking them up to each other (auto-wire)</li>
<li>Changes to IT roll out automatically to all the running machines.</li>
<li>Changes to the application roll out automatically to all the running machines.</li>
<li>Creating new environments to be as easy providing a simple parameter (e.g. &#8220;fed2&#8221;) to a CloudFormation</li>
<li>The whole thing working on EC2 or inside a Vagrant container&#8230; or even on bare metal (but that was not shown)</li>
<li>Incredible visibility into everything that happens within HipChat&#8230; for the whole team.</li>
</ul>


<p>By the end, we had machines tell us when they launched, when they were operational, when they were deploying a new
version, and whether that new version deployed successfully.</p>

<p><img src="/images/add-11/add11_autodeploy1.png" /></p>

<p>and finally, we had a running application at a human-usable URL:</p>

<p><img src="/images/add-11/add11_dns1.png" /></p>

<p>That could be scaled to any number of servers as load demands.</p>

<h2>Second series</h2>

<p>The above is the core of the ADD and enabling team productivity and customer visibility (even happiness)
to shoot through the roof.  It by itself is basically &#8216;complete&#8217;.  It is missing some details, nuances,
augmentation, and such.  But it alone is the core of a 4x productivity.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Complete! What nonsense!  Where are your automated tests!  How do you check for code quality!
What kind of programming language do you use!  And where is your description of Scrum, XP, Waterfall, etc. methodology
to use with this ADD?!!&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Ah&#8230; yes.  Over my <em>thirty five years</em> and estimated <em>thirty five thousand hours</em> of developing software,
I have encountered all these things.  I do have opinions
on a lot of these things.  Preferences.  Best practices.  You may be interested.  They matter.  A little.</p>

<p>How little?  Maybe&#8230; maybe&#8230; 2x.</p>
